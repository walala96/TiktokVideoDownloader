1. Ask the user for the TikTok video URL they want to download without a watermark.

   url = get_user_input()

2. Parse the URL to extract the video ID.

   video_id = parse_video_id(url)

3. Construct the download URL using the video ID.

   download_url = construct_download_url(video_id)

4. Send an HTTP GET request to the download URL.

   response = send_http_get_request(download_url)

5. If the response is successful, save the video file to the desired location on the user's device.

   if response.status_code == 200:
       video_file_path = save_video_file(response.content, "original.mp4")

6. Remove the watermark from the video file using a watermark removal algorithm.

   watermark_removed_file_path = remove_watermark(video_file_path)

7. Save the new video file without the watermark to the desired location on the user's device.

   save_video_file(watermark_removed_file_path, "no_watermark.mp4")

8. Notify the user that the download is complete and provide them with the location of the downloaded file without a watermark.

   show_download_complete_message(watermark_removed_file_path)
